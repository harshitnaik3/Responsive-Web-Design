        <h1 id="heading"><u>Here's a timeline of Shrinivasa Ramanujan's life (1887-1920)</u></h1>
        <ul id="timeline">
            <li><strong>1887</strong>- 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec, 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu state, India</li>
            <li><strong>1897</strong>- Just before turning 10,he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district and entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>1898</strong>- A child prodigy by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.</li>
            <li><strong>1901</strong>- By 14 he received merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1,200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35 teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series.</li>
            <li><strong>1902</strong>- Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations. he even developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year he tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it could not be solved by radicals.</li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong>- When he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems. Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail. The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in <strong>awakening his genius</strong>. The next year Ramanujan independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places</li>
            <li><strong>1904</strong>- He graduated from Town Higher Secondary School. awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum.</li>
            <li><strong>1910</strong>- After a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.<br>
                Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.

            <li><strong>1913</strong>- Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and E. W. Middlemast tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. M. J. M. Hill of University College London commented that<em>Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes</em>. He said that although Ramanujan had "a taste for mathematics, and some ability", he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.<br>
                On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy. Hardy was immpressed with the work of Ramanujan that he offered money alllowance and trip to Trinity College.</li>
            <li><strong>1914</strong>- On 14<sup>th</sup> April, He arrived in London. Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and published part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Hardy was an atheist whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights.

            <li><strong>1916</strong>- Ramanujan was awarded a Bachelor of Arts by Research degree (the predecessor of the PhD degree) in March 1916 for his work on highly composite numbers, sections of the first part of which had been published the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.</li>
            <li><strong>1917</strong>- Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.</li>
            <li><strong>1918</strong>- He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, the second Indian admitted, after Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841. At age 31 Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the Royal Society's history. He was elected "for his investigation in elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers."</li>
            <li><strong>1919</strong>- He was the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
            <li><strong>1920</strong>- He died at the young age of 32.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong>- On the 125th anniversary of his birth, the Indian government declared that 22 December will be celebrated every year as National Mathematics Day.</li>
